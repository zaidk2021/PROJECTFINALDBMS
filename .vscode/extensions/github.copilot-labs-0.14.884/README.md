**Copilot Labs is a place for GitHub to experiment with new ideas before we take them into production.
These experiments may never become part of the official product, or may change significantly before they become part of the supported product.
Because they are experimental, features may break, not work as expected, or otherwise fail to meet our quality standards for production-ready code.
All Copilot Labs features are provided "as-is" with no guarantees of support.**

**Finally, Copilot Labs is governed by separate terms.
GitHub may collect more/different telemetry in Copilot Labs because, again, the experiments are designed for learning and not production.**

# GitHub Copilot Labs

GitHub Copilot Labs is a companion extension to [GitHub Copilot](https://copilot.github.com) that houses experimental and up-and-coming features in a sidebar.

To learn more about GitHub Copilot Labs, [read our post](https://next.github.com/projects/copilot-labs/).

## Requirements

1. An active GitHub Copilot subscription. Visit the [Copilot Quickstart](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/quickstart#signing-up-for-github-copilot) to learn more.
2. You must have the main extension of [GitHub Copilot](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot) installed alongside Labs.
3. You'll need to [sign up](https://githubnext.com/projects/copilot-labs/) and accept the [GitHub Next Pre-Release License Terms](https://github.com/githubnext/githubnext/blob/main/TERMS_AND_CONDITIONS.md).

## Usage

For now Copilot Labs consists of a VS Code sidebar that houses distinct features. Once the Copilot Labs extension is installed, you'll see a Copilot icon in the sidebar. Clicking on that will bring up all of the experiments in separate panels.
